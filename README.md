This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the Air Quality Index (AQI) across various urban and rural locations, highlighting its implications for public health and environmental policy. By examining data collected over a year from multiple monitoring stations, we assess the temporal and spatial variations in air quality, focusing on key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and O3. Our findings reveal significant fluctuations in AQI levels, influenced by factors such as seasonal changes, traffic patterns, and industrial activities. We employ statistical methods to correlate AQI variations with health outcomes, demonstrating a clear relationship between elevated pollution levels and increased respiratory ailments. Additionally, the study discusses the effectiveness of current regulatory measures and suggests targeted interventions for improving air quality. The results underscore the urgent need for enhanced monitoring and proactive policies to mitigate air pollution and protect public health. This analysis serves as a crucial resource for policymakers, environmental agencies, and community stakeholders aiming to foster a healthier environment.
